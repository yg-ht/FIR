# FIR
## Fast Initial Recon

This is a new project designed to automate early enumeration tasks.

Probably not worth your time yet - best to wait for a version that does something ;-)

This project is written for Python3, so make sure you have Python3 dependencies installed:

- netaddr

On ubuntu-based distributions you can use:

    sudo apt install python3-netaddr python3-nmap
